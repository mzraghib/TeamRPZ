# TeamRPZ

The Phone Mouse application for Android with use on Windows.
In this project, we try to make an android app that controls the cursor on windows using the smartphone's sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, compass).
Users can then control sensitivity and use their phones for various applications like presentations, gaming, Image/ Video editing, etc.

#About Us
We are Android noobs trying to jump into Android programming with an ambitious project. We believe we'll be a force to reckon with in some time!

Our code lies in branches since nothing is final yet.
