# TeamRPZ

In this project, we made an android app that can control the cursor on windows not only by using the smartphone's touch interface but also through motion control using sensor(accelerometer). Users can then control sensitivity and use their phones for various applications like presentations, gaming, Image/ Video editing, etc.
We created a Bluetooth server on Windows to connect it with the phone, the server would receive the data and control the cursor.

#Things to Download:
1. Phone Mouse (For phone)
2. Bluetooth Server (For Windows PC)

#About Us
We are Android and Windows application noobs trying to jump into Android programming with an ambitious project. We believe we'll be a force to reckon with in some time!

#How-to
Simply click on the toggle button to move from Motion control to Touch control.

#Future Development
Coming soon on Android Smart-Watches!!!
