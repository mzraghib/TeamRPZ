# Rishab's branch
The folder AccelerometerExplorer is the graph app to check the effects of the various filters.
AccelerometerPlay is the sample app from Android Studio that has been modified to display one ball with the mean filter.
ExampleAccelerometer is the first app I made to display the acccelerometer values as Text. It has since been modified to implement the mean filter as well.
The Phone Mouse and the Bluetooth Server app are the same as in the master branch that were updated.
