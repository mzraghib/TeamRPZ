# TeamRPZ

In this project, we made an android app that controls the cursor on windows using the smartphone's sensor (accelerometer). Users can then control sensitivity and use their phones for various applications like presentations, gaming, Image/ Video editing, etc.
We created a Bluetooth server on Windows to receive the data and control the cursor.

#About Us
We are Android and Windows application noobs trying to jump into Android programming with an ambitious project. We believe we'll be a force to reckon with in some time!

#How-to
Given in the wiki!
